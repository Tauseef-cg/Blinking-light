 Simple Resistor Dimming
One of the easiest ways to change how bright an LED is, is by adding a resistor in series to limit the current. It works, but it's not very efficient and doesn’t allow for fine control over the brightness.

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
A smarter method involves turning the LED on and off very quickly at different intervals. Our eyes blend this rapid switching into a change in brightness. This technique, called PWM, is widely used in microcontrollers like Arduino because it’s much more efficient and precise.

Transistor-Based Control
When you want to control bigger or more powerful LEDs, you can’t always feed them directly from a microcontroller pin. Transistors come in handy here — they act like switches that can handle higher currents, making it easier to dim or control LEDs without damaging the microcontroller.

Constant Current Drivers
For powerful LEDs, it’s important to keep the current steady rather than just controlling voltage. Special constant current drivers are used to safely dim these LEDs and prevent damage from too much current.

Advanced Methods: Digital Potentiometers and DACs
For really fine-tuned brightness control, there are devices like digital potentiometers and DACs that let you adjust the LED brightness precisely by changing voltage or resistance digitally.
